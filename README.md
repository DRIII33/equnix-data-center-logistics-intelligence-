# Data Center Logistics Intelligence  
### Inventory, Shipments, Compliance, and Asset Lifecycle Management

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world logistics intelligence framework designed to support
mission-critical data center operations. It demonstrates how a Data Center Logistics Lead
can independently manage inventory accuracy, shipment velocity, safety compliance,
and equipment lifecycle tracking using data-driven decision-making.

The project reflects operational realities found in global data center environments,
including shipment delays, inventory shrinkage, hazardous materials handling,
and asset aging.

---

## Business Scenario
As data center operations scale, logistics teams must ensure that materials are
received, stored, moved, and dispatched accurately while maintaining compliance
with safety and regulatory requirements.

This project models how logistics intelligence supports:
- On-time delivery of customer equipment
- Accurate inventory allocation
- Compliance with hazardous materials protocols
- Proactive identification of aging and abandoned assets

---

## Core Capabilities Demonstrated
- Inventory management and reconciliation
- Shipping and receiving analytics
- Hazardous materials tracking
- Equipment and software license lifecycle management
- Independent operational problem solving
- Documentation accuracy and audit readiness

---

## Technology Stack
- **Google BigQuery** – Logistics data warehouse  
- **Google Colab (Python)** – Synthetic data generation and validation  
- **Looker Studio** – Operational dashboards  
- **Google Sheets** – QA and reconciliation workflows  
- **Google Docs** – SOPs and documentation  
- **GitHub** – Version control and governance

## Project Structure
The repository is organized to mirror enterprise data and operations workflows:
- Raw operational data
- Modeled analytics tables
- Dashboard-ready views
- Business documentation and SOPs

---

## Dashboards
The Looker Studio dashboards answer daily logistics questions:
- Which shipments are aging and require escalation?
- Which SKUs are below minimum stock?
- Where do inventory variances exist?
- Are hazardous materials stored and documented correctly?
- Which assets are approaching abandonment thresholds?

---

## Data Integrity & Governance
- Reproducible synthetic data generation
- Referential integrity checks
- Clear separation of raw, modeled, and analytical layers
- SQL-first metric definitions

---

## Intended Audience
This portfolio is designed for:
- Data Center Operations Leadership
- Logistics and Supply Chain Managers
- Operations Analytics Teams

## Disclaimer
This project uses synthetic data and does not represent real Equinix systems,
data, or operational processes.
